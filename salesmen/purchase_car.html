<p> The predecessors to SUVs date back to military and low-volume models from the late 1930s, and the four-wheel drive 
  station wagons and carryalls that began to be introduced in 1949. The 1984 Jeep Cherokee (XJ) is considered to be 
  the first SUV in the modern style. Some SUVs produced today use unibody construction; however, in the past, more SUVs
   used body-on-frame construction. During the late 1990s and early 2000s,
   the popularity of SUVs greatly increased, often at the expense of the popularity of large sedans and station wagons. </p>

<h3> SUVs have been criticized for a variety of environmental and safety-related reasons. They generally have poorer
   fuel efficiency and require more resources to manufacture than smaller vehicles, thus contributing more to climate
    change and environmental degradation.[3] Their higher center of gravity increases their risk of rollovers. Their
     larger mass increases their braking radius, reduces visibility, and increases damage to other road users in 
     collisions. Their higher front-end profile makes them at least twice as likely to kill pedestrians they hit.[4]
   Additionally, the psychological sense of security they provide influences drivers to drive less cautiously.[</h3>

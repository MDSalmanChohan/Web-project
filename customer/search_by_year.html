          <p style="background-color:rgb(255, 165, 0);">   The first working steam-powered vehicle
             was designed—and quite possibly built—by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish member of a Jesuit 
             mission in China around 1672. It was a 65-centimetre (26 in)-long scale-model toy for the Kangxi
              Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger.[13][26][27]
             It is not known with certainty if Verbiest's model was successfully built or run  </p>

        <p  style="background-color: yellowgreen;"> The development of external combustion engines is detailed as part of the history of the car but often treated 
            separately from the development of true cars. A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during 
            the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons,
             and steam rollers. In the United Kingdom, sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of 1865. </p>

        <p  style="background-color: darksalmon;">  In 1807, Nicéphore Niépce and his brother Claude created what was probably the world's
             first internal combustion engine (which they called a Pyréolophore), but they chose to install it in a
              boat on the river Saone in France.[30] Coincidentally, in 1807 the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz 
              designed his own 'de Rivaz internal combustion engine' and used it to develop the world's first vehicle to
               be powered by such an engine. The Niépces' Pyréolophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder
                (dried spores of the Lycopodium plant), finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil,
                 whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.[30] Neither design was very successful, as was the
                  case with others, such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey, and Etienne Lenoir with his hippomobile,
             who each produced vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by internal combustion engines.[</p>

           <p style="background-color: aqua;">
            A sport utility vehicle or SUV is a car classification that combines elements of road-going passenger cars with features from off-road vehicles, such as raised ground clearance and four-wheel drive.
           There is no commonly agreed-upon definition of an SUV and usage of the term varies between countries. Thus, 
            it is "a loose term that traditionally covers a broad range of vehicles with four-wheel drive."[1] Some definitions 
            claim that an SUV must be built on a light truck chassis; however, broader definitions consider any vehicle with 
            off-road design features to be an SUV. A crossover SUV is often defined as an SUV built
             with a unibody construction (as with passenger cars), however, in many cases, crossovers are simply referred to
              as SUVs.  </p>

       <h2>An ordered metal Car  List</h2>
       <p style="background-color:rgb(255, 165, 0);">   The Indian Car of the Year Award (ICOTY) is presented annually to
         the best new car launched in India, and is
         based on similar other awards such as European Car of the Year. The award was established in 2006, with the Maruti 
         Suzuki Swift winning the first award[1] and the Hyundai i20 winning the latest award in 2021.[2]

        Hyundai has won the award seven times, while Maruti Suzuki four times and Honda have won twice. Swift is the only car
         model to win the award three times. Most of the award-winning cars have been from Japanese or Korean manufacturers, 
         and are available globally in the same or different guises. The Hyundai Elite i20 and i10 Grand, for instance, are 
         available in Europe and Japan. The European Renault Duster developed by the Renault engineers, sold worldwide and 
         built in India yet got this award for 2013. The Maruti brand on Suzuki models is exclusive to India. The Honda City 
         is largely restricted to Asian and South American markets, while the Ford Figo is a modified version of the Ford 
         Fiesta that was sold in Europe from 2002 to 2008. The Honda Civic is a global model, although not all versions are
          sold on every market.
        
        ICOTY also awards the Premium Car Award, first awarded in 2019 for luxury and performance cars and the Green Car Award,
         first awarded for hybrid and electric cars in 2021.  </p>
